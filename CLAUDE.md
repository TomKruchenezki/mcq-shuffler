# MCQ Shuffler — CLAUDE.md

MCQ Shuffler is a client-side Hebrew web app that shuffles multiple-choice answer options
while preserving question text and answer text exactly.

---

## Core Invariant

The original **first** answer option in every question is the correct answer.
After shuffling, the app must track where that original first option moved
and generate an answer key.

---

## RTL Rules

These apply to every UI component, parser, and export module.

| Rule |
|---|
| Hebrew RTL is a core requirement, not a styling concern. |
| Never manually reverse Hebrew strings or characters. |
| Never inject hidden Unicode direction marks (U+202A, U+202C, etc.) into stored exam text. |
| Do not modify source question or answer text to fix visual direction. |
| RTL helpers (`wrapLtr`, `.ltr-isolate`) are allowed **only** for UI/display/export rendering. |
| Mixed Hebrew, English, numbers, SQL, formulas, dates, and percentages must remain readable. |
| Use `dir="rtl"` / `dir="auto"` HTML attributes and CSS `unicode-bidi` — never `bidi-override` on mixed content. |

---

## PDF Extraction Strategy

These apply to every change in `lib/extract/`.

| Rule |
|---|
| Never join pdfjs TextItems with `.join('')` — always use coordinate-aware reconstruction. |
| RTL gap: `(prev.x - prev.width) - curr.x`; LTR gap: `curr.x - (prev.x + prev.width)`. |
| `Y_TOLERANCE = 3.0`; `SPACE_THRESHOLD_FACTOR = 0.25`. Do not change without updating tests. |
| Header/footer safety guard: never remove lines starting with `שאלה`, `\d+.`, `.[א-ת]`, or `[א-ת][.)]`. |
| OCR must be local/browser-only (Tesseract.js WASM). No backend, no cloud, no paid AI. |
| Real exam PDFs go in `manual-fixtures/` (gitignored). Never commit them. |

---

## Privacy Rules

| Rule |
|---|
| Client-side only — no backend, no server. |
| No file upload to any external server or API. |
| No external APIs of any kind. |
| No paid AI or LLM calls. |
| Exams are processed locally in the browser only. |

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router, static export for GitHub Pages)
- **UI:** React 19 + TypeScript (strict) + Tailwind CSS v3
- **Tests:** Vitest + jsdom
- **Libraries (browser-only):** mammoth (DOCX extraction), pdfjs-dist (PDF), docx (DOCX generation)

## Commands

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies
npm run dev          # dev server at localhost:3000
npm test             # run Vitest once
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit (type check only)
npm run build        # static export to out/

# PDF fixture diagnostics (local-only, real PDFs in manual-fixtures/ — git-ignored)
npm run check:fixtures                           # verify PDFs are not git-tracked
npm run diagnose:pdf:all                         # analyze all manual-fixtures/*.pdf
npm run diagnose:pdf -- manual-fixtures/X.pdf   # analyze one PDF
# Output: .tmp/pdf-diagnostics/ (also git-ignored)
```

## Workflow Rules

1. **Work in small, focused steps.** Do not implement multiple major features in one change.
2. **After every meaningful change:** run `npm test` and `npm run typecheck`.
3. **Before moving to the next step:** summarize what changed, what was tested, and known limitations.
4. **Mock / fixture data first** — prototype against `fixtures/` before wiring real file input.

## Project Subagents

| Agent | When to use |
|---|---|
| `mcq-core-engineer` | Parser contracts, shuffle logic, answer key, invariant review, Step 4+ |
| `hebrew-rtl-reviewer` | Any change touching Hebrew text, RTL rendering, parser text, UI, or export |
| `qa-verifier` | Before completing each step — tests, typecheck, coverage audit |
| `pdf-extraction-engineer` | Any change to `lib/extract/` — pdfLines, pdfNormalize, extractPdf |
| `ocr-browser-engineer` | When implementing browser-side OCR for scanned PDFs |
| `pdf-visual-preservation-reviewer` | After any PDF/OCR changes — verify text fidelity |

| 4 | Shuffle logic and answer key | Done |
| 5 | UI flow (upload → parse → shuffle → preview) | — |
| 6 | DOCX and CSV export | — |
| 7 | DOCX / PDF file upload | — |
| 8 | GitHub Pages deployment | — |
